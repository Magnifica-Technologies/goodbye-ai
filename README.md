# goodbye-ai
A fun Chrome Extension that obfuscates any LinkedIn post related to AI.
# Why I created this?
It's June 2025, and let's be honest AI fatigue is very real. Especially on LinkedIn, where every other post screams about AI, machine learning, or LLMs. So I built a fun Chrome Extension that blurs them all out. Instant AI detox for your feed.

# How to install the extension

1. Download the zip file from the repo
2. Unzip the file
3. Go to chrome://extensions
4. Enable Developer Mode
5. Click "Load unpacked" and select the unzipped folder
6. Visit your [LinkedIn feed](https://www.linkedin.com/in/therobgregory/) and enjoy

## Disclaimer
Yes, the extension was made using AI. I know, very meta. It’s not in the Chrome Web Store, it’s completely unsupported, and absolutely not meant for anything serious. Consider it a five-minute distraction that mostly works.
